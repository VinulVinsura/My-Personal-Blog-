          <br>
          <p class="lead">My overarching goal in life is twofold: to achieve independence and bring pride to my parents.
            As a passionate software developer, I am driven by the desire to innovate and create solutions that solve
            real-world problems. My journey in this field is not just about mastering technical skills but also about
            making a meaningful impact through technology.

            In addition to excelling in software development, I am equally committed to becoming a proficient social
            worker. I envision using my knowledge and resources to contribute positively to society, advocating for
            causes that matter and empowering those in need. This dual commitment reflects my belief in the power of
            technology to drive social change and improve lives.

            Ultimately, my aspiration is to blend my technical expertise with my passion for social welfare, striving to
            be a catalyst for positive transformation in the world. By pursuing these goals diligently, I aim to not
            only achieve personal success but also leave a lasting legacy of service and impact.</p>
